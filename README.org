* wits 'n wagers
* overview

  [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] is a text editor.  an extensible one.  it is mainly used for
  coding, but it can also do anything else.  wits 'n wagers is a [[https://www.northstargames.com/products/wits-wagers-deluxe-edition][board
  game]].

  wnw.el can help you host a game of wits 'n wagers over a conference
  call (zoom/chime/meet).  wnw.el just helps to keep track of the
  board, but the original game is required for the questions.  wnw.el
  is built on top of [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

** gameboard

the gameboard is made up of two tables.  the first table lists the
players and information about each player's chips and bets.

- player :: player's name
- chips held :: the number of chips a player has that aren't on the board
- bets :: the number of bets the player has made (max of 2)
- chips in play :: the number of chips a player has allocated to current bets

the second table is equivalent to the green felt that comes with the
game. it lists the guesses and bets for the current round.

- guesser :: the names of the players that made this row's guess.
- guess :: the number that is the guess.
- bets :: the bets for this rows guess. bets are formatted as "name:chips".
- pays :: these are the rate at which the bets pay off.

** modeline

the steps to follow in each round, with the current step
capitalized. the steps are:

1. question
2. guess
3. bet
4. answer
5. next
